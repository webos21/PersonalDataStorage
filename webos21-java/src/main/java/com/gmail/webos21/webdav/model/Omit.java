/**
 * The <code>omit</code> XML element per the WebDAV specification [RFC 4918]
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    Name:       omit
 *    Namespace:  DAV:
 *    Purpose:    The omit XML element instructs the server that it should
 *    use best effort to copy properties but a failure to copy a property
 *    MUST NOT cause the method to fail.  Description: The default behavior
 *    for a COPY or MOVE is to copy/move all properties or fail the method.
 *    In certain circumstances, such as when a server copies a resource
 *    over another protocol such as FTP, it may not be possible to
 *    copy/move the properties associated with the resource. Thus any
 *    attempt to copy/move over FTP would always have to fail because
 *    properties could not be moved over, even as dead properties.  All DAV
 *    compliant resources MUST support the omit XML element on COPY/MOVE
 *    methods.
 * 
 *    &lt;!ELEMENT omit EMPTY &gt;
