## App for keeping the passwords

There is some apps on the android market.
But, I need the more simple one.


### Features

* User Authentication
* Keep the passwords with the AES-256 encryption
* Support the bulk-adding and bulk-getting by CSV(comma-seperated value)


### To-Do

* Add the web-access functionality with NanoHTTPD
